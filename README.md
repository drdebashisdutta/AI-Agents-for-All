## Building
AI agents are autonomous systems built to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment‚Äîoften mimicking human-like intelligence.

To create effective AI agents, you‚Äôll need a range of key components:  
- **Benchmarks** to evaluate performance  
- **Datasets** for training and fine-tuning  
- **Frameworks** for building and deploying agents  
- **LLMs** (like GPT-4) acting as the ‚Äúoperating system‚Äù for agents  
- **Prompt engineering** techniques (like Chain-of-Thought)  
- **Tools** that agents use to accomplish tasks  
- **Workflows** that connect everything together (e.g. with tools like Zapier)  

Each of these has its own dedicated section for easy exploration. As this field grows rapidly, staying up to date with these components is key to building powerful, next-gen agents.
